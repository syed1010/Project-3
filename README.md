# Music & Mental Health Visualization Project

## Overview

The Music & Mental Health Visualization Project aims to explore the relationships between different music genres and mental health conditions such as anxiety, depression, insomnia, and OCD. By analyzing data from a comprehensive survey on mental health and music preferences, this project seeks to identify potential correlations that could inform the development of more effective music therapy treatments. 

This project falls under the Data Visualization track and utilizes various data visualization techniques to present insights derived from the survey data.

## Project Purpose

The purpose of this project is to improve the understanding of how different genres of music may influence mental health. By identifying patterns and correlations, we hope to contribute valuable insights to the field of music therapy, ultimately aiding individuals seeking alternative or complementary treatments for mental health challenges.

## Instructions on Interactivity
Interactive Visuals on visualize_data.py file.
Explore the Data: Our visuals have the ability to view the data through various filters via dropdown functionality. One can filter a chart by the mental illness and view it’s severity levels across the age groups. One can also view overview stats through similar age group breakdowns.

## Ethical Considerations
Throughout the project, significant efforts were made to ensure ethical handling of the data. The survey itself was made to be as easily accessible as possible, via online forums and physical postings in public spaces, like parks & libraries.  Participants' privacy and confidentiality were prioritized, and names were not collected/included in survey results in order to keep privacy. Additionally, any person was welcome to participate. A wide range of ages were represented, and we made sure to acknowledge the range when creating visuals and making any conclusions.  
We acknowledge the sensitive nature of mental health data and took care to present findings in a manner that is respectful and avoids stigmatization.
Additionally, the project team is committed to using these findings responsibly, advocating for evidence-based practices in music therapy, and contributing positively to the discourse around mental health treatments.
